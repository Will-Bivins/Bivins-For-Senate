        <section class="preamble">
            <p>Dear Students, Teachers, and members of the University of Louisville Community. My name is Will Bivins and I am happy to present to you my campaign for College of Business Senator.</p> 
            <p>This is an interactive and live website and will be how I am presenting and organizing my information about my campaign. I built this website in <strong>Notion</strong>, a note-taking program that I’ve used throughout my high school and college career. My campaign is meant to serve as an example project that can be organized, executed, and published all in <strong><strong><strong>Notion</strong></strong></strong> itself. My two main goals are to listen to the General Student Body's opinions as well as provide tools and resources to the CoB Senate to improve logistics and information organization.The reason I chose <strong><strong><strong>Notion</strong></strong></strong> to present my information is I believe it is a very valuable tool to organize information, project timelines, team resources, and much more. It also teaches users entry-level coding mechanics that help them build logical thinking and organizational skills. Throughout this entry, I will be demonstrating different mechanics available in <strong><strong><strong>Notion</strong></strong></strong> while also explaining who I am and why I feel qualified to represent you in Senate.</p>  
            <p>Now, how are you seeing it published as a website? Through <strong>Notion</strong>’s exporting and code translation, I was able to build it in <strong>Notion</strong>, customize it to my preference, and host it as a website using a simple GitHub repository. Now, while it didn't look as pretty as it does now (I think it looks quiet nice...), by using a .css file, I was able to customize and add to the already built html <strong><strong><strong><strong>Notion</strong></strong></strong></strong> file.</p> 
            <p>While I am a business student, I strongly believe in the use of technology for the presentation of business-related technical information, company goals, and project management, and I am excited to demonstrate how it can be used throughout my campaign. <strong>Welcome to my campaign!</strong></p>
