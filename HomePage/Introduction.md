# Will Bivins Senate Campaign Summary

# Preamble

Dear Students, Teachers, and members of the University of Louisville Community. My name is Will Bivins and I am happy to present to you my campaign for College of Business Senator. 

This is an interactive and live website and will be how I am presenting and organizing my information about my campaign. I built this website in Notion, a note-taking program that I’ve used throughout my high school and college career. My campaign is meant to serve as an example project that can be organized, executed, and published all in Notion itself. My two main goals are to listen to what the general student body’s opinion on issues is as well as provide tools and resources to the CoB Senate to improve logistics and information organization.

The reason I chose Notion to present my information is I believe it is a very valuable tool to organize information, project timelines, team resources and so much more. It also teaches the user about entry-level coding mechanics that helps them build their logical thinking and organizational skills. Throughout this entry, I will be demonstrating different mechanics that are available in notion, while also explaining who I am and why I feel I am qualified to represent you in Senate. 

Now, how are you seeing it published as a website? Through Notion’s exporting and code translation, I was able to build it in notion and customize it to how I would like it to look, and by building a simple Github repository, it can be hosted as a website.

While I am a business student, I strongly believe in the use of technology for presentation of business related technical information, company goals, project management, and am excited to provide how it can be used throughout my campaign.
