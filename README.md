## Bivins For Senate

# The Official Repository of the Bivins CoB Senate Campaign

Dear Students, Teachers, and members of the University of Louisville Community. My name is Will Bivins and I am happy to present to you the Github Repository for my Senate Campaign.

Here, you can find the live additions and edits that I have made to my website. 

A main value of my campaign is the use of techonology in Corporate Logistics. Something that I want to bring to the College of Business Senate is the use of project management systems and technology in order to provide clear organization and feedback from the student body.

Furthermore, a main ideal of my campaign is Constituent Services. As your senator I intend on keeping updates on this website and provide spaces for collaboration. This is why I chose to use Github to present my information. Github is an Open-Source collaborative space for code. This allows anyone to view and suggest edits to my site, making this a collaborative effort built by all.
