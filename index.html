      <p>Dear Students, Teachers, and members of the University of Louisville Community. My name is Will Bivins and I am happy to present to you my campaign for College of Business Senator.</p> 
      <p>The reason that I chose to use a website to present my information is that I believe technology is a centerpiece for communicating ideas in a corporate setting. Over the past decades, we have seen an increase in new technological tools in the workplace, and I intend to bring those concepts to the College of Business Senate. While I am not claiming that I will simply build the College of Business a website for student outreach, this is meant to be an example as to how projects can be conducted.</p>
      <p>This is an interactive, live website built from scratch with <strong>Notion</strong> to organize ideas and resources, and GitHub to execute the files. My campaign is an example project organized and executed from Notion.</p>
      <p>Notion is a strong tool to convey ideas, organize information, project timelines, team resources, and more. It also introduces users to entry-level coding mechanics that help build logical thinking and organizational skills. Throughout this entry, I will demonstrate various mechanics available in Notion, while explaining who I am and why I feel qualified to represent you in Senate.</p>
      <p>As a business student, I believe in using technology for presenting business-related technical information, company goals, and project management. <strong>Welcome to my campaign!</strong></p>

      <p>My name is Will Bivins and I am a sophomore at the University of Louisville. Throughout my time at UofL I have learned how to manage my time and resources and plan to use them to represent you in the College of Business Senate.</p> 
      <p>I have lived in Louisville all my life and am grateful to attend school in my home city. I am proud of Louisville and draw inspiration from the changes I have witnessed over the years. Now that I have begun to learn the required technical tools—such as organization, interpersonal communication, and critical thinking—I feel prepared to represent the College of Business student body and my city in Senate.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity and the secretary of the University of Louisville Investment Club. Through these organizations, I have honed my organization skills and learned how to manage projects and listen to others. I intend to use these skills to serve you in the Senate.</p>

      <p>I aim to listen to the student body’s opinions on key issues and provide tools to enhance logistics and information organization within the CoB Senate.</p>
      <p>If I were to represent you in the College of Business Senate, the main sections I would address are as follows:</p>
      <p><strong>Student Outreach:</strong> By implementing new techniques for student outreach, the Senate can gather feedback and ideas while presenting information about changes to governing documents.</p>
      <p><strong>Information Organization:</strong> By adopting innovative methods for collecting, logging, and retaining data, the Senate can compile and record changes more effectively. I would also focus on presenting information in a way that meets the needs of the College of Business members.</p>
