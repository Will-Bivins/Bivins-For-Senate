            <p>Dear Students, Teachers, and members of the University of Louisville Community. My name is Will Bivins and I am happy to present to you my campaign for College of Business Senator.</p> 
            <p>This is an interactive and live website and will be how I am presenting and organizing my information about my campaign. I built this website in <strong>Notion</strong>, a note-taking program that I’ve used throughout my high school and college career. My campaign is meant to serve as an example project that can be organized, executed, and published all in <strong><strong><strong>Notion</strong></strong></strong> itself. My two main goals are to listen to the General Student Body's opinions as well as provide tools and resources to the CoB Senate to improve logistics and information organization.The reason I chose <strong><strong><strong>Notion</strong></strong></strong> to present my information is I believe it is a very valuable tool to organize information, project timelines, team resources, and much more. It also teaches users entry-level coding mechanics that help them build logical thinking and organizational skills. Throughout this entry, I will be demonstrating different mechanics available in <strong><strong><strong>Notion</strong></strong></strong> while also explaining who I am and why I feel qualified to represent you in Senate.</p>  
            <p>Now, how are you seeing it published as a website? Through <strong>Notion</strong>’s exporting and code translation, I was able to build it in <strong>Notion</strong>, customize it to my preference, and host it as a website using a simple GitHub repository. Now, while it didn't look as pretty as it does now (I think it looks quiet nice...), by using a .css file, I was able to customize and add to the already built html <strong><strong><strong><strong>Notion</strong></strong></strong></strong> file.</p> 
            <p>While I am a business student, I strongly believe in the use of technology for the presentation of business-related technical information, company goals, and project management, and I am excited to demonstrate how it can be used throughout my campaign. <strong>Welcome to my campaign!</strong></p>

                <p>My name is Will Bivins and I am a sophomore at the University of Louisville. Throughout my time at UofL I have learned about how to personally manage my time and resources and am looking to use them to represent you in the College of Business Senate. </p> 
                <p>I have lived in Louisville all my life and am so happy that I am able to attend the school in my home city. I am proud to call Louisville my home and I draw lots of inspiration from those around me and the changes that I’ve seen happen in the city throughout my life. Now that I feel that I have begun to learn the required technical tools I feel necessary to present my ideas, I feel that I am able to properly represent the College of Business student body and my city as a whole in the Senate.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity and the secretary of the University of Louisville Investment club. In both of these student organizations, I have built my personal organization skills and have learned about how to organize projects, listen to others, and . Through these student organizations, I have been able to build my personal organization skills and ideas for how information can be communicated and I intend on using these to serve you in the Senate.</p>

    <p>I aim to listen to the student body’s opinions on key issues and provide tools to enhance logistics and information organization within the CoB Senate.</p>
    <p>If I were to represent you in the College of Business Senate, the main sections that I would want to adress are as follows: </p>
    <p><strong>Student Outreach: </strong>By using new techniques for ease of student outreach, the Senate will be able to collect student satisfaction and ideas, as well as provide new ways of presenting information to students about what changes are being made to governing documents.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Organization: </strong> Through new methods of information collection and logging, through new methods of retaining information, the Senate will be able to better compile and record changes made. I would also focus on the presentation of information that best suits the needs of the members of the College of Business in order to provide the method that best conveys necessary information for undestanding the changes made by the Senate.</p>
